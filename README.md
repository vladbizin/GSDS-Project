# Classification of Tree Types using Earth Remote Sensing Data
This repository is dedicated to Home Assignment 1 project on GeoSpatial Data Science Course of HSE. The topic is Classification of Tree Types using Earth Remote Sensing Data. </br></br>
In this project i tried to recreate approach from [this paper](https://peerj.com/articles/5666/)  As a part of the assignment I had to record a presentation on my work so please make sure to watch the video and view the presentation to learn on the insights of this classification problem. The approach from the paper was slightly modified to improve performance of classifers. To learn more, watch the vide or view the presentation. ;) </br></br>
Huge thanks to the Christopher B. Anderson - the author of the paper - for letting me learn from him and Ethan White - Associate Professor, Dept. Wildlife Ecology & Conservation, University of Florida - for providing me with the ground truth data to evaluate my models' perfomances. </br></br>

N.B. I am not competeing with the authors of the paper and do not claim any authorship on the approach. I apologize in advance if I somhow minterpreted your paper and belittled your achievements. </br>
N.B. 2 If you have any question regarding the code make sure to contact me.
